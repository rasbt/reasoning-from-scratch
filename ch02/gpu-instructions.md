# GPU Cloud Resources

This section describes cloud alternatives for running the code presented in this book.

While the code can run on conventional laptops and desktop computers without a dedicated GPU, cloud platforms with NVIDIA GPUs can substantially improve the runtime of the code, especially in chapters 5 to 7.

## Using Lightning Studio

For a smooth development experience in the cloud, I recommend the [Lightning AI Studio](https://lightning.ai/) platform, which allows users to set up a persistent environment and use both VSCode and Jupyter Lab on cloud CPUs and GPUs.

Once you start a new Studio, you can open the terminal and execute the following setup steps to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasbt/reasoning-from-scratch.git
cd reasoning-from-scratch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(In contrast to Google Colab, these only need to be executed once since the Lightning AI Studio environments are persistent, even if you switch between CPU and GPU machines.)

Then, navigate to the Python script or Jupyter Notebook you want to run. Optionally, you can also easily connect a GPU to accelerate the code's runtime, for example, when you are pretraining the LLM in chapter 5 or finetuning it in chapters 6 and 7.

## Using Google Colab

To use a Google Colab environment in the cloud, head over to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) and open the respective chapter notebook from the GitHub menu or by dragging the notebook into the *Upload* field as shown in the figure below.

Also make sure you upload the relevant files (dataset files and .py files the notebook is importing from) to the Colab environment as well, as shown below.

You can optionally run the code on a GPU by changing the *Runtime* as illustrated in the figure below.
