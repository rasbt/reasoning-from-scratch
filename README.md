In [*Build a Reasoning Model (From Scratch)*](https://mng.bz/lZ5B), you will learn and understand how a reasoning large language model (LLM) works.

Reasoning is one of the most exciting and important recent advances in improving LLMs, but itâ€™s also one of the easiest to misunderstand if you only hear the term reasoning and read about it in theory. This is why this book takes a hands-on approach. We will start with a pre-trained base LLM and then add reasoning capabilities ourselves, step by step in code, so you can see exactly how it works.

The methods described in this book walk you through the process of developing your own small-but-functional reasoning model for educational purposes. It mirrors the approaches used in creating large-scale reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1, GPT-5 Thinking, and others. In addition, this book includes code for loading the weights of existing, pretrained models.

## Companion Book

Please note that *Build A Reasoning Model (From Scratch)* is a standalone book focused on methods to improve LLM reasoning.

In this book, we work with a pre-trained open-source base LLM (Qwen3) on top of which we code apply reasoning methods from scratch. This includes inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning, and distillation.

However, if you are interested in understanding how a conventional base LLM is implemented, you may like my previous book, [*Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*](https://amzn.to/4fqvn0D).

## Hardware Requirements

The code in the main chapters of this book is designed to mostly run on consumer hardware within a reasonable timeframe and does not require specialized server hardware. This approach ensures that a wide audience can engage with the material. Additionally, the code automatically utilizes GPUs if they are available. That being said, chapters 2-4 will work well on CPUs and GPUs. For chapters 5 and 6, it is recommended to use a GPU if you want to replicate the results in the chapter.


(Please see the [setup_tips](ch02/https://github.com/rasbt/reasoning-from-scratch/blob/main/ch02/01_main-chapter-code/python-instructions.md) doc for additional recommendations.)

&nbsp;
## Exercises

Each chapter of the book includes several exercises. The solutions are summarized in Appendix B, and the corresponding code notebooks are available in the main chapter folders of this repository (for example,  [`ch02/01_main-chapter-code/ch02_exercise-solutions.ipynb`](ch02/01_main-chapter-code/ch02_exercise-solutions.ipynb)).

## Questions, Feedback, and Contributing to This Repository


I welcome all sorts of feedback, best shared via the [Manning Discussion Forum](https://livebook.manning.com/forum?product=raschka2&page=1) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rasbt/reasoning-from-scratch/discussions). Likewise, if you have any questions or just want to bounce ideas off others, please don't hesitate to post these in the forum as well.

Please note that since this repository contains the code corresponding to a print book, I currently cannot accept contributions that would extend the contents of the main chapter code, as it would introduce deviations from the physical book. Keeping it consistent helps ensure a smooth experience for everyone.
